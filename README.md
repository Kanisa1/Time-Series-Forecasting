# Air Quality Forecasting with Deep Learning

## üìå Project Overview
Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), poses serious risks to public health and the environment. This project develops a **deep learning model** to forecast PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using time-series data.  

We implement and compare different architectures, with the final optimized **ConvLSTM model** achieving strong performance on both validation and Kaggle test datasets.

## üìä Dataset
- Source: Beijing PM2.5 dataset (UCI & Kaggle sources).
- Features: Meteorological data (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and PM2.5 concentrations.
- Target: PM2.5 concentration levels.
- Preprocessing:
  - Missing values imputed
  - Normalization applied
  - Train-validation-test split

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The project followed a **machine learning pipeline**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Trends, correlations, and seasonality studied  
   - Outliers and missing data addressed  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Baseline: Simple LSTM  
   - Optimized: Conv1D + Stacked BiLSTM + Attention + Dense layers  

   ### Final Model Architecture:
   - 1D Convolution (feature extraction)  
   - Batch Normalization  
   - Bidirectional LSTM layers  
   - Attention mechanism  
   - Global Average Pooling  
   - Dense + Dropout  
   - Output layer (linear activation)  

3. **Training & Optimization**  
   - Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Optimizer: Adam (lr=3e-4)  
   - Regularization: Dropout & Early stopping

## üìà Results and Discussion
- **Validation RMSE**: **21.05**  
- **Kaggle Public Leaderboard RMSE**: **4256.7329**  
- Improvement: **16% reduction** compared to baseline.  

### Key Findings:
- Convolutional layers improved feature extraction.  
- Longer sequence lengths captured temporal context better.  
- Lower learning rates stabilized training.  
- Dropout + Early stopping prevented overfitting.  
- Stacked BiLSTMs overcame vanishing gradient challenges.  

### RMSE Formula:
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]

**Future Work:**
- Integrate external datasets (traffic, holidays, industrial activity).  
- Explore advanced architectures (Transformers, Temporal Fusion Transformers).  
- Use Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Apply explainability techniques (SHAP, attention visualization).
